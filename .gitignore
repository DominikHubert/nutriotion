# Dependencies
node_modules/
package-lock.json
# (package-lock.json is debated, but often committed. I will check if user wants it ignored. 
# Actually, for apps, it SHOULD be committed. I will leave it OUT of ignore unless requested.)
# Correction: I will NOT ignore package-lock.json as it ensures reproducible builds.
